## Overview
This is end-to-end Travel insurance claim prediction machine learning project with Flask web app which predicts claim of customer insurance.
Data has collected from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/mhdzahier/travel-insurance

### Buisness problem : A third-party travel insurance servicing company that is based in Singapore, they want to predict which customer claim should accept or decline according to their records on insurance list. 

#### The attributes:

1. Target: Claim Status (Claim.Status)
2. Name of agency (Agency)
3. Type of travel insurance agencies (Agency.Type)
4. Distribution channel of travel insurance agencies (Distribution.Channel)
5. Name of the travel insurance products (Product.Name)
6. Duration of travel (Duration)
7. Destination of travel (Destination)
8. Amount of sales of travel insurance policies (Net.Sales)
9. Commission received for travel insurance agency (Commission)
10. Gender of insured (Gender)
11. Age of insured (Age)

## Approach towards end-to-end solution
#### To do an end-to-end Machine Learning project we need to do the following steps

1. Understand the requirements of the business.
2. Acquire the dataset.
3. Visualize the data to understand it better and develop our intuition.
4. Pre-process the data to make it ready to feed to our ML model.
5. Try various models and train them. Select one that we find best.
7. Present your solution to the team.
8. Deploy on production environment.
